### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (40%)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS (vanilla)


### What I learned

- regex in javascript. 
- a little more about positioning (absolute/relative etc.)
- more practice with flexbox
- a little neat thing I did was for the hover on socials, I added a border to them and then added the bg, that way the color is seen. I had never thought of that before, so, chuffed!
